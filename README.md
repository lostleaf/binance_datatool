A modern Python toolkit for downloading, verifying, and managing
[Binance historical market data](https://data.binance.vision/) — designed
from the ground up for AI agents and quantitative workflows.

## Why Agent-First?

Most market-data tools are built for humans clicking through GUIs.
**binance-datatool** is different — every command is designed to be
called by AI agents just as easily as by a human:

- **Composable CLI** — stdin/stdout pipelines let agents chain
  commands without glue code
- **Atomic operations** — each command does one thing well; agents
  can inspect, decide, and act step by step
- **Deterministic output** — structured, parseable results that
  agents can reason about
- **Zero interaction** — no prompts, no confirmations; dry-run mode
  for safe previews

## Features

- **Multi-market coverage** — Spot, USD-M Futures, and COIN-M Futures
- **Smart symbol filtering** — filter by quote asset, exclude stablecoins
  and leveraged tokens, select contract types
- **Resumable batch downloads** — diff-based sync via
  [aria2](https://aria2.github.io/) that only fetches new or updated files
- **Data integrity verification** — SHA256 checksum validation with
  timestamped marker caching
- **Composable pipelines** — Unix-friendly design; commands read from
  stdin and write to stdout
- **Async I/O** — concurrent S3 listing and parallel checksum verification

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — fast Python package manager
- [aria2](https://aria2.github.io/) — required for the `download` command

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lostleaf/binance_datatool.git
cd binance_datatool
uv sync
export BINANCE_DATATOOL_ARCHIVE_HOME=$HOME/crypto_data/binance-archive
```

### Try it

```bash
# List USDT-quoted spot symbols, excluding stablecoins
uv run binance-datatool list-symbols spot --quote USDT --exclude-stables

# Download daily 1m klines
uv run binance-datatool list-symbols spot --quote USDT --exclude-stables \
  | uv run binance-datatool download spot --type klines --interval 1m

# Verify integrity
uv run binance-datatool verify spot --type klines --interval 1m BTCUSDT
```

## Supported Data Types

| Category | Types |
|----------|-------|
| Trade data | `klines`, `aggTrades`, `trades` |
| Derivatives | `fundingRate`, `liquidationSnapshot`, `metrics` |
| Order book | `bookDepth`, `bookTicker` |
| Index data | `indexPriceKlines`, `markPriceKlines`, `premiumIndexKlines` |

Each type is available in **daily** or **monthly** partitions. Kline types
support all standard intervals (`1m` `3m` `5m` `15m` `30m` `1h` `2h` `4h`
`6h` `8h` `12h` `1d` `3d` `1w` `1mo`).

## CLI Overview

The entry point is `binance-datatool`. All data commands are available
directly on the root app:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `list-symbols` | List available symbols on the remote archive |
| `list-files` | List archive files for given symbols |
| `download` | Download new or updated archive files |
| `verify` | Verify files against SHA256 checksums |

> [!TIP]
> Every command accepts symbols from **stdin** or as **positional args**,
> making it trivial to compose pipelines:
>
> ```bash
> binance-datatool list-symbols um --quote USDT \
>   | binance-datatool download um --type klines --interval 1m
> ```

Run `uv run binance-datatool --help` for the full option reference.

## Architecture

```
CLI Layer        Thin Typer commands (argument parsing, output formatting)
    │
Workflow Layer   Business logic (diff computation, verification protocol)
    │
Archive Layer    S3 communication (HTTP listing, aria2 downloading, checksums)
    │
Common Layer     Shared types, enums, constants, and utilities
```

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for a detailed design overview.

## Vision

binance-datatool is the data foundation for agent-driven quantitative
research. Next up: **Agent skills** — packaged capabilities that let AI
agents autonomously discover, fetch, and validate market data end-to-end.
